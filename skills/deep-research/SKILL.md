# Deep Research Skill

Conduct thorough research using multiple sources and perspectives.

## When to Use
- Complex technical questions
- Evaluating multiple options
- Understanding best practices
- Investigating unfamiliar topics

## Research Protocol

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
1. Clarify the research question
2. Identify key terms and concepts
3. Define success criteria

### Phase 2: Source Gathering (Parallel)

**Official Sources:**
- Use context7 for library documentation
- Check official GitHub repositories
- Review official blogs/announcements

**Community Sources:**
- Stack Overflow for common issues
- GitHub issues for edge cases
- Blog posts for tutorials

**Code Examples:**
- Search GitHub for implementations
- Check popular open source projects
- Review test files for usage patterns

### Phase 3: Synthesis

Combine findings into actionable insights:

```markdown
## Research Summary: [Topic]

### Key Findings
1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]
3. [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
- **Best Option**: [recommendation with reasoning]
- **Alternative**: [alternative with trade-offs]

### Implementation
\`\`\`typescript
