# /ultrawork - Full Autonomous Orchestration

[ULTRAWORK MODE ACTIVATED]

You have requested maximum precision autonomous execution.

## What This Means

1. **Parallel Exploration**: Multiple agents search simultaneously
2. **Comprehensive TODO**: Every step tracked and verified
3. **Smart Delegation**: Specialists handle their domains
4. **No Partial Work**: 100% completion guaranteed

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (Parallel)
```
→ Launch explorer agents for codebase mapping
→ Launch librarian for external documentation
→ Gather all context before planning
```

### Phase 2: Planning
```
→ Create comprehensive TODO list
→ Break into atomic, verifiable steps
→ Identify dependencies
```

### Phase 3: Execution
```
→ Execute each step
→ Verify before marking complete
→ Delegate to specialists as needed
```

### Phase 4: Verification
```
→ All TODOs complete
→ Tests pass
→ Build succeeds
→ Request fulfilled
```
